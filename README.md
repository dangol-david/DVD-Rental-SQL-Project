Introduction
Welcome to the DVD Rental Database Project, a hands-on application of PostgreSQL, the powerful open-source object-relational database system. 🎓

This project encapsulates 15 meticulously designed tables: 'actor', 'film', 'film_actor', 'category', 'film_category', 'store',
'inventory', 'rental', 'payment', 'staff', 'customer', 'address', 'city', and 'country'. Each table represents various facets 
of a real-world DVD rental business. 📊

As you navigate through this project, you'll gain practical insights into the capabilities of PostgreSQL, refine your database 
management skills, and understand complex data structures and relationships. Welcome to a learning journey that unravels the 
intricate operations of a DVD rental store. 🚀

 #Objective:
Implement SQL querying techniques to explore and manipulate the data.
Utilize PostgreSQL database system for managing and interacting with the data.
Leverage Git commands for version control and effective collaboration.
Maintain comprehensive project documentation and a well-structured code repository here on GitHub.
